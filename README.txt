****Welcome to this repository****

Here, I've practiced and applied all the instructions, commands and
concepts I'd learned from DIO instructors in this project.

Commands used so far:
*git init 
*git clone 
*git add
*git commit
*git push
*git remote
*git pull
*git config

It has been a great experience.
